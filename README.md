### An example of my skills 

Here's some code I wrote in `R`:

```
zim %<>%
    mutate(
      edLevel = fct_collapse(
        hv109, # factor you want to change
        dknr = '9', # new = 'old category'
        none = 'no education',
        primary = c('complete primary','incomplete primary'),
        secondary = c('complete secondary','incomplete secondary'),
        tertiary = 'higher'
      )
    )
    
```
```
mean(x$var1)
```
